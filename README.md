# ElecttroPi DataPrepKit
## Python programing foundation


## Project Description
Python package that serves as a comprehensive toolkit for preprocessing datasets, using NumPy and Pandas
This toolkit has functions to seamlessly read data from various file formats, provide a data summary, handle missing values, and encode categorical data


## Features:
1. Data Reading: Implement functions to read data from different file formats such as CSV, Excel, and JSON, using Pandas.
2. Data Summary: Develop functions that print key statistical summaries of the data, including the average and most frequent values, utilizing NumPy and Pandas.
3. Handling Missing Values: Create functions to handle missing values by either removing or imputing them based on predefined strategies.
4. Categorical Data Encoding: Implement encoding functions for categorical variables, enabling users to convert them into numerical representations.
5. Package Deployment: Publish the DataPrepKit package on PyPI to make it easily accessible to the broader Python community.
